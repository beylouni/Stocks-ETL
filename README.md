## What's about? 🤔
### Learning new technologies and applying what we've learned.

A personal mini project that aims to retrieve stocks market info about chosen companies in _B3_. In first place, the project is to web scrap these infos and send 
them to a _RDS_ database in _AWS_. Further on, some data analysis will be made, developing some 
insights regarding these companies´ stocks behavior.


## How it works? 👷
